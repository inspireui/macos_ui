# Contributing to macos_ui

Thanks for checking out `macos_ui`! We appreciate your interest in contributing! Here are some 
basic things you'll need to know to get started.

### Branch structure

The default branch for this project is `dev`. Your work should take place in a branch checked out
from here. `stable` is reserved for releases to pub.dev. All pull requests should therefore
target `dev`.

### Commit style
This repository uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Please ensure that you use them!

### Versioning

`macos_ui` uses semantic versioning. However, at this time (Apr 17, 2021), `macos_ui` is still a 
very early project. As such, we are only incrementing the `revision` placement (0.0.X). Once `macos_ui`
is stable or robust enough for pub releases, we will start incrementing the minor and major revisions.
